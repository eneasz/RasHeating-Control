#This library is is a simple script that is using an external  scheduler plan in from a dictionary in custom.py where you can define your own scheduler for each day. Library checks what day is today and if there is a scheduler for this day it will check if there is anything set up for curent time and upon match it will use a duration to determinate when task should end and run it for set duration.
